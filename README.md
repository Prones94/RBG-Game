# Color Picker!

## Description
A link to the github Live Page:  https://prones94.github.io/RBG-Game/
A simple game that allows users to learn colors using rgb values. The main objective of this game is for users to learn and then effectively use new colors instead of looking for a helper online.


### Languages USed
- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla Javascript
## Usage
When entering the website, users can automatically see the heading, and right below it, a question that asks what rbg value this is.

Below the header there is some different color boxes that show up. Depending on what mode, the boxes can range from 3 to 9

IF the user guesses wrong, the program will fade away the incorrect box and then ask you to pick again. Once choosing the right color, the heading and all the boxes will change into the same color as the correct answer and you will win. The computer will then ask if you'd like to play again.
